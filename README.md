Facial Image Quality Assessment
This is an android application that will allow the user to provide either a predefined gallery image or take a picture using their camera to be imported into this application. From there the software will determine the image quality by giving scores to the software in terms of: Brightness, Contrast, Facial Image Size, etc. It will take these scores from a CROPPPED image of the face that it recognizes using the default android facial recognition libraries.
